<!-- GET AND POST
You’ll see in your Python and HTML code that GET and POST are
request “methods” – method here just means the way that the request needs
to be handled/sent (i.e. they’re not functions). GET is the default method in both Python and HTML for getting information
from the server. The data from a GET request is shown in the URL in your
browser. For example, @app.route(“/news”) is actually a GET request, just like
typing bbc.co.uk/news into your browser and hitting enter. Both of these
things are saying “hey server, get me this specific webpage”.
You can submit a form using GET or POST. If you submit a form using GET,
you’ll see the submitted form data in your URL bar in your browser.
Sometimes that doesn’t matter (if you’re searching for a bookshelf on IKEA’s
website, you might want to bookmark the results page). But there are other
times, like if a visitor is submitting personal information through a form,
when you need that information to be sent privately.
The POST method is used to send data to the server so that it can be
processed. It’s like saying “hey server, here’s some data for you to do stuff
with”. In HTML, you can only make a POST request using a form. Information
sent using the POST method doesn’t show in the URL bar, so it’s more
private.
Remember, when using a form, you need to specify the request type you’re
using in the HTML form’s opening tag, and also in Python. Notice that in
HTML, GET and POST methods are typed in lowercase, and in Python, they’re
in uppercase.
NB: GET is default so dont need to specify in python file
